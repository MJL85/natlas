# About

natlas is a python application framework which includes a discovery engine, an API, and a front-end cli for running available modules.

##### For Users
The `natlas-cli.py` program allows you to browse and execute any natlas module, including, among others, the network discovery and diagram module.

##### For Developers

Copy `docs/template_module.py` to a new file in the `modules/` directory.
Edit the function `mod_load()` to set the name and help properties for your module.
The entry function for any module is `mod_entry()`.
When creating a new module, natlas will create a new object and pass it to mod_entry().  From there the natlas API is available and includes functions such as:
- discover_network()
- query_node()
- get_switch_vlans()

Once saved, your module will automatically be listed in `natlas-cli.py list` and runnable.

# Modules
| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| diagram | Discovers a network and generates a diagram based on CDP and LLDP neighbor information. |
| get-mac-table | Collect a list of all MAC addresses on the discovered network and generate a report. |
| get-arp-table | Collect a list of all ARP entries. |
| get-hosts | Determine all hosts connected to one or all switches in the network. Includes MAC, IP, DNS name of each host, along with what switch and port it was found on. Can be exported to CSV. |
| tracemac | Trace a MAC address through a layer 2 network. |
| newconfig, showconfig, checkconfig | Modules to create, display, and validate natlas configuration files. |

# Network Discovery  
  
The discovery process uses SNMP, CDP, and LLDP to discover the network topology and details about each node.  Each discovered node will be evaluated against the `discover` ACL (defined in the config file) to determine how to proceed; the ACL may allow discovery, stop discovery here, or include it as a leaf in the diagram.

<table>
	<tr>
	<td valign=top rowspan=2>
		The <i>discover</i> ACL is defined as
	<pre><code>"discover" : [
	ACE1,
	ACE2,
	...
	ACEn,
]</code></pre>
	</td>
	<td valign=top>
		An <i>ACE</i> is defined as  
	<pre><code>&lt;permit|deny|leaf|include|;&gt; &lt; [host REGEX] | [ip CIDR] &gt;</code></pre>
	</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>
Example
	<pre><code>"discover" : [
	"deny ip 10.50.12.55",
	"deny host ^SEP.*",
	"permit ip 10.50.12.0/24",
	"leaf host ^Switch2$",
	"permit ip any"
]</code>	</td>
	</tr>

| `discover` | Defines a Cisco-style ACL. See the `Network Discovery` section. |
| `diagram` | Defines values used by the diagram module.  Detailed below in the *Diagram block* table. |

# Diagram
natlas will attempt to collect the following information and include it in the generated diagram:
+ All devices (via CDP and LLDP)
+ Interface names
+ IP addresses
+ VLAN memberships
+ Etherchannel memberships (LACP only)
+ Identify trunk links
+ Identify switched links
+ Identify routed links
+ BGP Local AS
+ OSPF Router ID
+ HSRP Virtual IP
+ HSRP Priority
+ VSS Domain
+ Stackwise membership
+ VPC peerlink information

#### Diagram Formatting
+ Nodes
  + Circle nodes represent layer 2 switches.
  + Diamond nodes represent layer 3 switches or routers.
  + If a node has multiple borders then either VSS or StackWise is enabled.
    + VSS - Will always have a double border.
    + StackWise - The number of borders denotes the number of switches in the stack.
  + If the configuration specifies, VSS/VPC/Stackwise nodes will be grouped in larger squares.
+ Links
  + Links are shown with arrowed lines.  The end with no arrow is the *parent* and the end with the arrow is the *child*, such that the arrangement is *parent*->*child*.
  + If a link says *P:gi0/1* , *C:gi1/4* then the parent node's connection is on port gi0/1 and the child node's connection is on port gi1/4.
  + If the link is part of an Etherchannel the etherchannel's interface name will also be shown.  Since an etherchannel interface is locally significiant, a *P:* and *C:* will also be shown if available.

# FAQ

#### Q1 - My diagram is too large.  I only want to diagram part of my network.
Try changing the config `discover` ACL to narrow down the scope of your discovery.  You can explicitly deny CIDR's or host name regex patterns if you do not want them included in your diagram.  
  
#### Q2 - Where is the config file?
Create a new one with
`# natlas-cli.py newconfig > natlas.conf`

#### Q3 - I need a diagram with less proprietary information. Can I get one without IPs or serial numbers?
You can change the text inside each node by editing the config option `diagram\node_text`. Below is an example that would produce a minimal information diagram:

```
"diagram" : {
	node_text = '<font point-size="10"><b>{node.name}</b></font><br />{node.ios}<br />{node.plat}'
}	
``` 
#### Q4 - How can I remove Cisco VoIP phones from my diagram?
```
"discover" : [
	"deny host ^SEP.*$"
]
```
